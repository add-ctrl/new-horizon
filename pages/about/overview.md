<h3 class="heading text-center">33+ YEARS OF INDUSTRY LEADERSHIP</h3>

<p>
For more than 33 years, the founder Greg Boyles has been a leader in the oil exploration
and production industry. Initially establishing New Horizon Exploration, Inc. (1985) as a
modest, family-owned and operated regional exploration company mainly focused in the
Fort Worth and Delaware Basins. Over time, expanded its operation into the DJ, LA and
Santa Maria Basins and drilled some of the first horizontal wells in each of the basins
before George Mitchel taught us to frack themâ€¦ Then, transitioned into an international
company, capable of operating successfully anywhere in the world with primary
operations in Trinidad and Colombia.

In time, New Horizon Global, Inc. was organized (2008) as a privately held company in
the United States to separate certain assets owned by New Horizon Exploration, Inc.
and to operate them independent of the other both domestically and internationally.
